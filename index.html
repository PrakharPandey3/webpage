            </div>
                <li>Camels’ humps are not used to store water. Even though they come from hot climates, their humps store fat and also help the rest of their bodies to stay cooler. When needed, the fat will be converted to food or water.</li>
                <li>The word ‘camel’ comes from an Arabic word, when it’s literally translated, it means beauty. Don’t ever try and say that camels are ugly!</li>
                <li>They need to stay hydrated in the desert, so it’s no surprise that camels can drink as much as 40 gallons of water at once. Considering it’s not being stored in their humps, that’s pretty amazing.</li>

                    <li>The vibration of drum like tymbals generates the songs due to the rapid movement.</li>
                    <li>Cicadas can be found living in the trees. The eggs will be put at the slit of the bark. The sap is the primary food for cicadas.</li>

                            <li>Pandas are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!</li>
                            <li>Baby pandas are born pink and measure about 15cm – that’s about the size of a pencil! They are also born blind and only open their eyes six to eight weeks after birth.</li>
                            <li>The giant panda’s scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means “black and white cat-foot”.</li>
